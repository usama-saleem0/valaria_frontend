              <p>
                This Terms of Use Agreement describes your rights and
                responsibilities relating to the Site that provides an

                binding agreement between you, on the one hand, and Ms. Sistrunk
                on the other hand. Additional terms that govern certain products
                or services (for example, rules of participation in Site
                Guidelines) are also applicable if you participate in those
                products and/or services and are incorporated into these Terms
                of Use Agreement by reference. There are eligibility
                requirements for this Site. This Site is governed by and
                operated under U.S. law.

                shall post or display notices of material changes on the Site
                and/or e-mail you or notify you upon login about these changes;
                the form of such notice is at our discretion. Once we post them
                on the Site, these changes become effective immediately and if
                you use the Site after they become effective it will signify
                your agreement to be bound by the changes.

                post, revoking your right to use the Site and using other means
                to enforce the terms of this Terms of Use Agreement.
